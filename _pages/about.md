Hello! I am a third year PhD Student in Artificial Intelligence from the [VANDAL](https://vandal.polito.it/) lab at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Averta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i4rm0tYAAAAJ), and currently visiting the [LTS4](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/) lab at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), under the supervision of [Prof. Pascal Frossard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-Ve9sJ0AAAAJ). I am also part of the [ELLIS PhD & Postdoc Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).

**What can artificial intelligence learn by watching videos of human activities in the wild?** Can we build models that understand the hierarchical and compositional nature of human activities? In my PhD, I'm exploring how to build video understanding models that can capture these hierarchies and learn abstract concepts from video that are interpretable and reusable.

When I am not in the lab (it happens sometimes), you can find me hiking or brewing beer at home üçª.
